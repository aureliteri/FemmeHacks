Our team includes Amy Ouyang, Katherine O'Connor, and Shreya Patil.

We are dedicated to empowering women and hearing their stories from around the globe. There is low representation of women in historically men dominated fields such as politics, business, and STEM. Our hope is to inform the challenges of women through current events and how to overcome this issue.
